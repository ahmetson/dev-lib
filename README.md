# Dev Lib and Context
The *Dev* module exposes a developer context.

The contexts access to the *config* engine.
And to the *dep* manager.

This is the developer context.
The configuration engine in the developer context is
working with local yaml files.
The dep manager in the developer context is using the local
directory.
